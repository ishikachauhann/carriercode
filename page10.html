<h1>WORKING WITH NULL VALUES</h1>
<p>In terms of the relational database model, a NULL value indicates an unknown value. If we widen this theoretical explanation, the NULL value points to an unknown value but this unknown value does not equivalent to a zero value or a field that contains spaces. Due to this structure of the NULL values, it is not possible to use traditional comparison (=, <, > and <>) operators in the queries. As a matter of fact, in the SQL Standards using the WHERE clause as the below will lead to return empty result sets.


For this reason, working with the NULL values might be a bit complicated and are required to use certain built-in functions which are customized for handling NULL values.
