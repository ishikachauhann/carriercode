<h1>CREATION AND DELETION OF VIEWS</H1>
<h2>1. Creation of view:</h2>
<p>In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.

A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.

You can add SQL statements and functions to a view and present the data as if the data were coming from one single table.

A view is created with the CREATE VIEW statement. 

<H2>CREATE VIEW Syntax:</H2>
<B>CREATE VIEW view_name AS<br>
    <button>
SELECT column1, column2, ...<br>
FROM table_name<br></b></button>
<h1>
Output:<h2>
    <img src="images/view.PNG">
    <br>
    2. Deletion of view:</h2>

Why use the SQL DROP VIEW statement?<BR>
When a view no longer useful you may drop the view permanently. Also if a view needs change within it, it would be dropped and then created again with changes in appropriate places.

<h2>DROP VIEW SYNTAX:</H2>
<b>DROP VIEW view_name  </b>
