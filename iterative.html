    <h1>Iterative Control Structures</h1>
    <p>Iterative control structures in PL/SQL are used to repeat a block of code until a certain condition is met. There are three types of iterative control structures in PL/SQL:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>SIMPLE loop : It is mainly used for infinite loops.</li>
		<li>FOR loop : It is used to iterate over a specified range of numbers or a collection.</li>
		<li>WHILE loop : It is used to repeat a block of code until a certain condition is met.</li>
	</ul>

    <h3>SIMPLE loop</h3>
	<p>The syntax of a SIMPLE loop is as follows:</p>
	<pre>LOOP
    -- Statements to be executed
END LOOP;</pre>
	<p>We can also terminate loop using  exit </p>
    <pre>exit when condition;</pre>
	<br>

	<h1 >Output:</h1>

	<h3>FOR loop</h3>
	<p>The syntax of a FOR loop is as follows:</p>
	<pre>FOR loop_counter IN [REVERSE] lower_bound..upper_bound LOOP
    -- Statements to be executed
END LOOP;</pre>
<br>

	<h1 >Output:</h1>
	<img src="images/for.PNG">
	<p>Here, loop_counter is a variable used to count the iterations, lower_bound is the starting value of the loop counter, upper_bound is the ending value of the loop counter, and REVERSE is an optional keyword used to reverse the direction of the loop.</p>

	<h3>WHILE loop</h3>
	<p>The syntax of a WHILE loop is as follows:</p>
	<pre>WHILE condition LOOP
    -- Statements to be executed
END LOOP;</pre>
<br>

	<h1 >Output:</h1>
	<img src="images/while.PNG">
	<p>The condition is a Boolean expression that is evaluated at the beginning of each iteration. If the condition evaluates to TRUE, the loop continues. If the condition evaluates to FALSE, the loop terminates.</p>
